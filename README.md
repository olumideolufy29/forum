# Phosphorum 2

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/phalcon/forum.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/phalcon/forum)

This is the official Phalcon Forum you can adapt it to your own needs or improve it if you want.

Please write us if you have any feedback.

Thanks.

## NOTE

The master branch will always contain the latest stable version. If you wish
to check older versions or newer ones currently under development, please
switch to the relevant branch.

## Get Started

### Requirements

To run this application on your machine, you need at least:

* [Curl][1] extension
* [Openssl][2] extension
* Internationalization ([intl][3]) extension
* Mbstring ([mbstring][4]) extension
* [Composer][5]
* PHP >= 5.4
* [Apache][6] Web Server with [mod_rewrite][7] enabled or [Nginx][8] Web Server
* Latest stable [Phalcon Framework release][9] extension enabled
* [Beanstalkd][10] server

### Installation

Install composer in a common location or in your project:

```sh
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Create the composer.json file as follows:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "phalcon/forum": "^2.0"
    }
}
```

Run the composer installer:

```sh
$ php composer.phar install
```

Then you'll need to create the database and initialize schema:

```sh
$ echo 'CREATE DATABASE forum CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci' | mysql -u root
$ cat schemas/forum.sql | mysql -u root forum
```

#### Initial Test Data

You can create fake entries on an empty Phosphorum installation by running:

> Note: The script random-entries.php must be executed inside the scripts directory

```bash
$ cd scripts
$ php random-entries.php
```

Change the owner of `app/logs` and `app/cache` to whatever user your web server is running as.

This application uses Github as authentication system, you need a client id and secret id
to be set up in the configuration (`app/config/config.php`).

#### Starting the Beanstalkd client

A PHP client to deliver e-mails must be enabled in background:

```bash
$ php scripts/send-notifications-consumer.php &
```

## Tests

Phosphorum use [Codeception][11] functional, acceptance and unit tests.

First you need to re-generate base classes for all suites:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/codecept build
```

Sure, for acceptance tests you also need [Selenium server][12] executable as well.
You need Java installed in order to run the Selenium server. You can launch it by running this:

```bash
$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.37.0.jar
```

> Note: replace 2.37.0 to your version.

> Note: Selenium may not support the most recent versions of Firefox.

Execute all test with `run` command:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/codecept run
# OR
$ vendor/bin/codecept run --debug # Detailed output
```

Execute `unit` test with `run unit` command:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/codecept run unit
```
